# Python Programming Semester Project 

## Introduction
This project focuses on data handling using Python, including reading, processing, and saving a dataset using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The script is designed to load weather data from a CSV file, process it by performing various operations, and save the processed data in different formats.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Weather Data from Kaggle, which includes a synthetic dataset that explores weather patterns and predictions across 10 locations.

## Setup
To run this project, you need to have Python and the following packages installed:
- pandas
- matplotlib

## File Structure
- see_pandas.py: This is the main script that handles data loading, processing, and saving using OOP principles.
- weather_data: The weather dataset used for this project.
- README.md: Documentation
- load_data.html: Automatically generated documentation for the project code.

## Usage
To load, process, and save the dataset, follow these steps:

1. **Load Data**:
   The `DataFetcher` class is responsible for loading the weather data from a CSV file. You can adjust the file path in the script to point to your data source.

2. **Process Data**:
   The `DataProcessor` class allows you to describe the dataset, show the first few rows, or generate visualizations.

3. **Save Data**:
   The `DataStorage` class saves the processed data to CSV, JSON, or Excel formats.
